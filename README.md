### Icons
#### I made my decision to implement icons , from a - __[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)__ . Selected icons assist and visual way to help you navigate the website.
#### Navbar will transform to a hamburger icon to meke easier to navigate on mobile devices

### Colors
#### As I told before , colar are based on colors used on K-fit logo. I didn't want to use too much color on the web page :

* #3f3f3f: This color will be used for the navbar it will be separated from the rest of the content even on the page  
* #a6187f: This color will be used for the border and a color of content on site.
* #fafafa: This color it's use primary for background-color. Everything will separate nicely on it
