### Colors
 As I told before , colar are based on colors used on K-fit logo. I didn't want to use too much color on the web page :

![Color Palette](/workspace/K-Fit/images/wireframes/Color Hunt Palette 276531.png)
* #3f3f3f: This color will be used for the navbar it will be separated from the rest of the content even on the page  
* #a6187f: This color will be used for the border and a color of content on site.
* #fafafa: This color it's use primary for background-color. Everything will separate nicely on it
