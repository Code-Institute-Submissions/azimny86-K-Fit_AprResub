## **Design Choices**

Design choices were based took from the K-fit logo. I made all my design choices from colors use in the logo.

<br/>

## Fonts
**************************************************************************************************************************

<br/>

## Icons

I made my decision to implement icons, from a  __[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)__ .
  Selected icons assist and visual way to help you navigate the website. Navbar will transform into a hamburger icon to make it easier to navigate on mobile devices.

<br/>

## Colors

As I told before,  I based on colors used on the K-fit logo. You can see my color palette __[here](https://colorhunt.co/palette/277227)__. I didn't want to use too much color on the web page :

![Color Scheme](images/wireframes/Color-Hunt-Palette276531.png)
* #3f3f3f: This color will be used for the navbar it will be separated from the rest of the content even on the page  
* #a6187f: This color will be used for the border and color of content on site.
* #fafafa: This color is used primarily for background color. Everything will separate nicely on it
